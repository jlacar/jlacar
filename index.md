## About me

I'm a long-time developer and student of agile methods. Continuing to find my stride as a coach with a strong focus 
on agile technical practices like emergent design, BDD/TDD, refactoring, automated testing, and pair/mob programming.

## About this blog

I started this blog as a way to organize my thoughts around various things that interest me. A recurring theme will 
be how to learn and practice techniques in a deliberate, systematic, and disciplined way to maximize learning and 
minimize churn.
